Send data to Amazon Glacier service periodically.

Have you ever thought that your server could have some backup in the cloud to mitigate some crazy [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware) infection? Great! Here is a peace of software to help you do that, sending your data periodically to [Amazon Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/). It uses the [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/) for all tasks, so this program is really only a dummy layer to make your life easier, all honors go to the [Amazon developers](https://github.com/orgs/aws/people).

**This software is still under development.**
