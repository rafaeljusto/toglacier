  # Owner File (Same Directory as Source File).
  #
  # When a previously saved file is opened for editing, for printing, or for
  # review, Word creates a temporary file that has a .doc file name extension.
  # This file name extension begins with a tilde (~) that is followed by a
  # dollar sign ($) that is followed by the remainder of the original file name.
  # This temporary file holds the logon name of person who opens the file. This
  # temporary file is called the "owner file."
  #
  # When you try to open a file that is available on a network and that is
  # already opened by someone else, this file supplies the user name for the
  # following error message: This file is already opened by user name. Would you
  # like to make a copy of this file for your use?
